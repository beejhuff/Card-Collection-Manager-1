# Card Collection Manager

## Project Description
This projects provides a management application for Magic the Gathering card collections. Its aim is to be a simple solution to keep track of collections. The main reason why I wrote this application because I required a tool, which can manage single card images of a large collection, beside common card collection management features.

The application is completely written in Java, using Swing for the graphic interface and the built-in serialization for saving the collection data.
